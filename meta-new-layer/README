This is an example illustrating the new layer creation in yocto
and writing recipe to build the files and making the build part
of the final image.

I use Helloworld as an example. After adding layer, building the
helloworld, the executalble will be part if the image. You can
run helloworld to get console print `Hello World!!`.

NOTE: Using this example, you can add your recipe of interesst
can be built and add it to the rootfs of the image.
